**What is this project about?**

Our project is about making an Android marketplace/forum app, where you can communicate with people and sell or buy used items off the posts. Just contact the seller 
and buy the sold item. With like and comment system you can also see if a seller is doing a good deal or not or you could use it to see if the seller is trustworthy
or not.

**What we used for the project.**

We used Kotlin as a base with Jetpack Compose and Firebase for our App. Firebase storage for the Images and Firebase database for our data,
along with Firebase authentication for login and register and finally their Cloud storage service for real time commenting.

**How to use?**

Install the APK and use it. (After the App is done it will be here, !!!Remove this line after done!!!).
If you want to use our code just put your own Firebase to it and use according to our models (if you want).
When cloning, please sync the project in your Android Studio.
